	 <h3 id="census">Census</h3>
	 
	 <p>2020’s population census pushed through in September, with strict health standards and close coordination between the PSA and local governments in place. Originally scheduled in May, the census was moved to later months as most parts of the country were placed under lockdown.<sup><a href="#text-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
	
	 <h3 id="education">Education</h3>
	 
	 <p>President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the suspension of classes at all levels, both public and private, in Metro Manila until March 14, 2020 as the number of cases rose.<sup><a href="#text-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Public schools covered by class suspensions due to the pandemic were not allowed to hold final examinations for students. New guidelines said exams for the fourth quarter, scheduled from March 16-20, “will no longer be administered” in areas with suspended classes. DepEd said schools which continue to hold classes must conduct the exams this week on a “staggered basis.” Students should come to school in varying schedules to take the tests with social distancing protocols.<sup><a href="#text-ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
	 <p>Some graduation rites were either canceled or postponed due to the extended ECQ. Meanwhile, some schools held their ceremonies virtually with the help of DepEd and Microsoft’s collaboration project titled #Hello2020Graduates.<sup><a href="#text-ref-4">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="#text-ref-5">[5]</a></sup> While students will not be able to physically go to schools, DepEd said that class suspensions might still be declared especially during inclement weather or during “extreme cases.”<sup><a href="#text-ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
	 
	 <h3 id="tourism">Tourism</h3>
	 
	 <p>The National Museum of the Philippines closed to the public on March 13. The closure covered all of the museums within its network in and outside of Manila. These include the National Art Gallery, the Museum of Natural History, the Museum of the Filipino People, and the National Planetarium, all located within Manila, as well as its branch museums and archaeological sites such as those in Bohol, Palawan, Butuan, Marinduque, and Jolo.<sup><a href="#text-ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
	 <p>The DOT's Philippine Shopping Festival, a scheduled nationwide mall sale in March aimed at cushioning the economic impact of the outbreak, was postponed.<sup><a href="#text-ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
	 <p>Local governments were forced to stop the staging of festivals and other events when the number of cases started to climb. At least 65 festivals, including local government events, scheduled from February to June, were either canceled or postponed.<sup><a href="#text-ref-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
	
	 <div class="text-beside-image">
	  <h3 id="prisons">Prisons</h3>
	  
	  <p>The status of Philippine prisons are considered hazardous as the congestion rate in 467 jails is at 534%. This ranks them the highest in the world in jail occupancy rate.<sup><a href="#text-ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
	  <p>The BJMP has closed all prisons in the NCR from visitors for two weeks, as well as other prisons in Ilocos, Central Luzon, and the Davao region. However, visitors can talk to PDLs with the help of e-dalaw.<sup><a href="#text-ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
	  <p>A group of 22 political detainees appealed for “humanitarian considerations” in asking the Supreme Court to temporarily free them and others who were elderly, sickly or pregnant. They said their age and health made them vulnerable to contract the virus.<sup><a href="#text-ref-12">[12]</a></sup></p>

	 <p>As the number of positive coronavirus cases continued to rise in the Philippines, local sports leagues were forced to cancel their events:<sup><a href="#text-ref-13">[13]</a></sup></p>
	 
	 <ul>
	  <li>On March 9, DepEd announced that the 2020 Palarong Pambansa, originally set to be on May 1 to 9, will be postponed.</li>
	  <li>The PBA decided to shorten its season, announcing on April 7 that it plans to hold only two conferences. On March 11, the PBA suspended its 45th season, just days after the league’s opening ceremonies. The suspension also includes the PBA D-League Aspirants Cup and the inaugural PBA 3×3. Following the postponement of the league, the PBA ordered on March 13 to cancel all team practices until March 27.</li>
	  <li>On March 19, the NCAA Policy Board officially terminated Season 95. A week earlier, the NCAA announced the postponement of all sporting activities until further notice. The league had already postponed events effective February 14 before deciding on March 10 to extend the delay. Also, the NCAA-South participated by colleges and universities in Region IV-A, suspended all its events starting March 10.</li>
	  <li>On March 13, the Philippine Football Federation (PFF) and Philippine Football League (PFL) announced that the opening of the 2020 PFL season, originally set on March 21, has been tentatively moved to April 18.</li>
	  <li>The division finals of Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League (MPBL) were suspended indefinitely, according to a statement released on March 12. Game 3 of both North and South division finals were originally scheduled on March 14 before the league decided to move it to a later date.</li>
